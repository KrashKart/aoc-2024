# AOC 2024 :santa:
A repo containing my code for [AOC 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about), created by the wonderful [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/).

This is my 2nd year participating, and I look forward to solving the code challenges this year! Unfortunately, I will not be tracking leaderboard position or solve timings, partly due to the fact that I will be overseas (and unable to complete the problems daily) for a large chunk of December and also partly because I do not want to rush myself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do check out my [AOC 2023](https://github.com/KrashKart/aoc-2023) repo!

# Challenge
As a challenge, I plan to use different languages to solve the problems (instead of only Python in AOC 2023). The languages I plan to use are:

- [x] Python (duh)
- [x] Java
- [x] Ruby
- [ ] C++

And the languages I plan to pick up are:

- [ ] Rust
- [ ] JavaScript
- [x] Go
- [x] Holy C (unfortunately could not get this to work because Strings are weird in HolyC)
- [ ] PyGyat (for maximum Brainrot)
- [ ] ??? idk :sweat_smile:

# Days
> [!NOTE]
>  * A completion of 2 stars will be noted as ( :star: :star: ) and 1 as ( :star: ).
>  * The programming language(s) used for each day will be displayed in *italics*.
>  * Day names contain clickable links to the AOC problems.
